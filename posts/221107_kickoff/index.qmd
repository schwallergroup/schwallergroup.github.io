Last week we had our kickoff group meeting! 

It was awesome to see what our talented group members presented only a few months after starting their PhD and projects. 

Say hi to [Anna Kapeliukha](https://twitter.com/AKapeliukha), who will be with us for 3-month project. 

Anna, it's a great pleasure to have you here!

After the group meeting, we went to a Chinese restaurant and discovered many delicious dishes [Junwu](https://twitter.com/JunwuChen25) had ordered for us. Thanks, Junwu!
