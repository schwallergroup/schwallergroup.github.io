    "text": "With a solid background in Pharmaceutical Sciences and specialized knowledge in medicinal chemistry and drug design, I possess the unique ability to integrate computational approaches in the creation of novel small molecules. The interdisciplinary nature of my work, bridging the realms of chemistry, biology, and computer science, is of special interest to me. This interdisciplinarity is further enabled by a joint supervision arrangement between LIAC and LPDI (Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering). LIAC brings expertise in AI for chemistry, while LPDI offers deep knowledge in structural biology and computational protein design. This collaboration enables me to leverage diverse perspectives and cutting-edge methodologies to drive my research forward.\nMy main interest lies in the development and application of machine learning tools for drug design. I am driven by the opportunity to address unresolved challenges in drug development and provide support to experimentalists. Through my research, I aim to make a tangible impact by facilitating the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics.\nOutside of work, you can find me in the mountains, where I am skiing, hiking or climbing. Additionally, I enjoy live music and exploring new coffee spots all over the world.\nI am genuinely excited about the prospect of learning new machine learning methods, contributing to the design of novel drugs, and collaborating with exceptional peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster thesis in the Coley Group at MIT in collaboration with the Schneider Group at ETH Zurich\nMSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich\nBSc in Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich\n\n\n\n\n\n — https://mailhide.io/e/i6PiL7mC\n — https://twitter.com/RebeccaNeeser\n — https://github.com/rneeser\n — https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8097znEAAAAJ&hl=en"

    "text": "With a background in chemical engineering, I have had the privilege of pursuing my research jointly between EPFL and IBM Research in Zürich. My passion lies in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemistry, with a particular focus on catalysis.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to understanding and harnessing the power of AI to revolutionize the field of chemistry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and computational models, I aim to unravel the complexities of catalytic processes and develop innovative solutions to advance sustainable chemistry.\nBeyond the realm of research, I find great joy in engaging in various activities such as Squash, running, and hiking. Additionally, I love exploring the art of cooking, experimenting with flavors and techniques to create delectable dishes that nourish both body and soul.\nI am truly excited to be a part of this scientific group, where we can collaborate, exchange ideas, and push the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Together, we can pave the way for transformative advancements in the world of AI-driven chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster thesis at Jensen Group at MIT\nMSc in Bio & -Chemical Engineering from ETH Zürich\nBSc in Chemical Engineering from ETH Zürich\n\n\n\n\n\n — https://mailhide.io/e/PXqg7siy\n — https://twitter.com/OSchilter\n — https://github.com/O-Schilter\n — https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EiKaR5IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"
