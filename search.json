He leads the Laboratory of Artificial Chemical Intelligence, which works on AI-accelerated discovery and synthesis of molecules. Philippe is also a core PI of the NCCR Catalysis, a Swiss centre for sustainable chemistry research, education, and innovation. He belongs to a new generation of scientists with a very wide-ranging set of skills – in his case a combination of chemistry, materials science, computer science, and experimental research."
